## Introduction
This repository is a run through Ansible components providing the necessary hands-on to build automation with a good set of principles and best practices. This is not a course.

### what's Ansible?
In a nutshell, Ansible is a mean to execute remotely without any agent some tasks that have been written within a descriptive language.

![preview](ansible_arch.png)

Idempotent
```
Being idempotent allows the defined task to run one time or a thousand times without having an adverse effect on the target system, only ever making the change once. 
In other words, if a change is required to get the system into its desired state, the change is made; and if the device is already in its desired state, no change is made. 
This is unlike most traditional custom scripts and the copy and pasting of CLI commands into a terminal window. When the same command or script is executed repeatedly on the same system, errors are (sometimes) raised.
```

Network Automation with Ansible

### Installation
The installation is straight forward since Ansible is available within almost all major distributions like CentOS/RHEL. For more details: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html

### The key to success
Ansible is agentless and doesn't work in a pull approach but in push with credentials.

#### Linux
When it comes to Linux, the connection towards the target is done through SSH.
This is a very basic process, unless SSH has been disabled, only a valid user with SUDO rights is necessary along with a password-less connection. 

To do so, have a bit of play with: 
```
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id user@host
ssh user@host
```
#### Win
When it comes to Windows, the connection towards the target is done through WinRM.
Since Windows Vista, WinRM is shipped standard with Windows but needs to be enabled. 
Here is two references to make it happen painless:
* The following powershell script can be used to enable it:
https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/examples/scripts 
* A good blog post about to connect to a Windows host:
https://www.ansible.com/blog/connecting-to-a-windows-host 


### Localhost sweet localhost
After installing Ansible, the following can be tried:
```
ansible localhost -m ping
```
The expected outcome is:
```
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
```
Then try the following:
```
ansible localhost -m setup
``` 
Let's discuss about facts for 2 minutes, then forgot about it for a couple of hours and come back to it.

### Inventories
Ansible inventories are much more than just a list of target to run automation on and as such it deserves some real attention with some best practices.

Here is a bad example:

```
[mydb]
10.1.2.3
10.1.2.4

[myweb]
myhost01.mydomain.com
myhost02.mydomain.com
```
The above is indeed just a list with no real interest or power features.
What about this one:

```
[mydb]
db1     ansible_host=10.1.2.3
db2     ansible_host=10.1.2.4

[myweb]
web1    ansible_host=myhost01.mydomain.com
web2    ansible_host=myhost02.mydomain.com
```
Then, the concept of groups can be used to make easier automation
```
[mydb]
db1     ansible_host=10.1.2.3
db2     ansible_host=10.1.2.4

[myweb]
web1    ansible_host=myhost01.mydomain.com
web2    ansible_host=myhost02.mydomain.com

[dev]
db1
web1

[uat]
db2
web2
``` 
This inventory will allow to deploy a common set of packages and configurations towards 'mydb' and 'myweb' then deploy the application set towards a the group 'dev' and/or 'uat' with key differentiator like dataset, testings, ... 

The last addition to the inventory is about variables liked to it like:
```
[dev:vars]
var1=valuexyz
var2=valueyxz
```
When working with a large or/and complex inventory, the following CLI commands are useful:
```
$ ansible-inventory -i 101/examples/ --list
{
    "_meta": {
        "hostvars": {
            "db1": {
                "ansible_host": "10.1.2.3"
            }, 
            "db2": {
                "ansible_host": "10.1.2.4"
            }, 
            "web1": {
                "ansible_host": "myhost01.mydomain.com"
            }, 
            "web2": {
                "ansible_host": "myhost02.mydomain.com"
            }
        }
    }, 
    "all": {
        "children": [
            "dev", 
            "mydb", 
            "myweb", 
            "uat", 
            "ungrouped"
        ]
    }, 
    "dev": {
        "hosts": [
            "db1", 
            "var1=valuexyz", 
            "var2=valueyxz", 
            "web1"
        ]
    }, 
    "mydb": {
        "hosts": [
            "db1", 
            "db2"
        ]
    }, 
    "myweb": {
        "hosts": [
            "web1", 
            "web2"
        ]
    }, 
    "uat": {
        "hosts": [
            "db2", 
            "web2"
        ]
    }
}

$ ansible-inventory -i 101/examples/  --graph
@all:
  |--@dev:
  |  |--db1
  |  |--var1=valuexyz
  |  |--var2=valueyxz
  |  |--web1
  |--@mydb:
  |  |--db1
  |  |--db2
  |--@myweb:
  |  |--web1
  |  |--web2
  |--@uat:
  |  |--db2
  |  |--web2
  |--@ungrouped:
```
Note how the variables have been merged with their respective group of hosts.

### Ansible Configuration
Let's rewind a bit! So far the topics of installation, connection, and inventory have been discussed. It's time to get a view on how to impact them on a global scale with the "ansible.cfg" config that can be present at the following locations:
* /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg      (global and first in line)
* ~/.ansible.cfg    (hidden file in user home directory)
* ./ansible.cfg     (current directory)

A custom version of the file can be as simple as:

```
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = user
ask_pass = false

[privilege_escalation]
become = true
become_method = sudo
become_user = root
become_ask_pass = false
``` 
Note that these newly defined values can be overridden in playbook or with CLI options. The content of the "/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg" is available within this repository for reference.

The ansible binaries will check those location and pick one of them considering the precedence of each of them. To verify which configuration file has been taken by the binaries, the following command can be used:

```
$ ansible --version
ansible 2.9.1
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = [u'/home/rovandep/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.5 (default, Sep 26 2019, 13:23:47) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-39)]

```

## Let's automate the world

### Principles 
Some principles to keep in mind during this workshop and as takeaways:
* automation should be considered as coding and as such the content should be hosted on version-control system like Git. 
* better have a KISS than a sorry... Keep It Stupid Simple; start with basic playbook and static inventory then fluff© it up
* plan-create-test-(feedback-)deliver loop (think DevOps) then refactor and modularize later
* use modules as much as possible!
* resort to using shell or command only when a module is not available

### Write with style
Along with the thousands benefits of using Ansible, one "cons" is definitely linked to YAML and the strict syntax that will give any Automation Engineers some head scratching and some swearing...

So:
* be consistent with your indenting 
* indentation is done with space not tab
* use linting module in your favorite Code editor
* plan-create-test-(feedback-)deliver loop (think DevOps) then refactor and modularize later

The two following tasks will produce exactly the same but the second one is the prefered approach for ease of reading:
```
- name: http service
  service: name=httpd state=started enabled=yes
```

```
- name: http service
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: started
    enabled: yes
```

### Module documentation
Well... hold on Johnnyboy... riding requires to:
* know all the rules... checked (well... almost but we're good for now)
* know all the tools... well modules... soon to be checked:

At the time of writing this workshop, the module listing is available at the following link: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html 

When there is no direct access to the internet, the following can be used to list and access module documentation:
```
ansible-doc -l
ansible-doc <module name>
ansible-doc service
```
All module documentaion comes with a parameter tables and examples which are really useful to start writing a playbook. Use them without moderation!

### No fake news, only facts
* know all the facts...checked

Remember the big blob:
```
ansible localhost -m setup
``` 
The big blob is the identity card of the host, in this case the localhost.

What about making a first playbook to illustrate the usage of facts:
```
---
- name: playing with facts
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: true

  tasks:
  - debug: 
      var: ansible_facts 

  - debug: 
      msg: "Host {{ ansible_hostname }} runs {{ ansible_distribution }}"

```
The above returns:
* all the facts (gather_facts is true) for the localhost (defined as hosts)
* the message with the hostname and distribution type of the localhost

Note that the "{{ some_name }}" is how to call a variable's value.


### Will it be my first
Ok... well let's get to it! What is required?

* some hosts to run automation on
* an inventory
* a playbook
* some facts
* and learning by doing 

Let's work on 
* 101-1-127-facts.yml
* 101-2-all-facts.yml
* 101-3-vars-loops.yml
* 101-4-first_real_play.yml (this one is hosted but was fully created by the team)

### Handling Handling
Handler can be seen as a specific inactive tasks unless when being triggered by other tasks. This task will run one time after all the other tasks have completed successfuly (or ignore_error is used).  
This last statement has an exception which can be trigger with flush_handlers but will be discussed here.

See 101-5-handler.yml

### Can you keep a secret?
Ansible comes with a Vault to keep the secrets from untrusty eyes. Here is the step to use the Vault:

```
ansible-vault create vault.yml
``` 
This will ask for a Vault password and then open the file with the local editor.
Insert the following two lines:

```
ansible_ssh_user: myuser
ansible_ssh_pass: mypass
```

To execute a playbook with a Vault use the following:

```
ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass playbook.yml
``` 

A very good reference of all the combinaison can be found here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-vault-to-protect-sensitive-ansible-data-on-ubuntu-16-04

Let's use the 101-6-vault folder to create a vault file and use it in a playbook.

### Welcome the new user
With all that has been seen so far, let's create a new user on the destination machines called "ansible", configure the user to be able to sudo, and provide the user with a password-less connection. (Hint: lineinfile and authorized_key)

Thinking about how to send the user password through the playbook without showing a plain text password (Hint: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_vault.html#single-encrypted-variable).

Once the user has been created on all the Linux machines, it can be used as a default user for all the Ansible playbooks by modifying the ansible.cfg accordingly. 

### Path to the role
Let's have a look at the directory 101-6-divided.
This comes back the KISS principle. When a playbook start to be very long, it makes sens to split it in logical small playbook and call them from main one.

### Role?
The concept of a role is basically giving a structure to a larger playbook. When a playbook starts to have multiple different elements like vars file, some many tasks that can be split into small chunck like seen previously, mainly templates, ... then the role provide a good way to structure the content and make it more production ready.

Let's create the skeleton of a role :
```
ansible-galaxy init my_new_role
```
But you will still need to have a "base" playbook calling the role. 
Note that in a more complex scenario, this "base" playbook can call multiple role one after the other, including conditional runs (when).

### A window to the world
Let´s create a first playbook for Windows to gather the disk facts:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/win_disk_facts_module.html#win-disk-facts-module

Here is a reference for the secrets or the previous references can help too: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/windows_winrm.html#inventory-options

### Conditions
During this workshop, the "when" has been introduced to run or not a task based on a logical expression. 

### If
While using the "when", the need of "if" has been expressed a couple of time. Here is an example how to provide a value based on another one:

```
---
- hosts: localhost  
  gather_facts: false

  vars:
    - test: "{{ 'oof' if myvar == 'foo' else 'rab' }}"
  tasks:
  - debug:
      msg: "myvar is {{ myvar}} giving the value {{ test }}"

``` 
With as results:

```
$ ansible-playbook test.yml -e "myvar=foo"

PLAY [localhost] *********************************************************************************************************

TASK [debug] *************************************************************************************************************
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": "myvar is foo giving the value oof"
}

PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=1    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   

$ ansible-playbook test.yml -e "myvar=foobar"

PLAY [localhost] *********************************************************************************************************

TASK [debug] *************************************************************************************************************
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": "myvar is foobar giving the value rab"
}

PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=1    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   

```
### Tags
Tags a "sticker" to be added to tasks in order to get the ability to run only some of the tasks based on the tasks.

```
ansible-playbook 101-11-tag.yml
ansible-playbook 101-11-tag.yml --tags "jo" 
```
