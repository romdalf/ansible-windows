# 101 - Ansible Crash-Course Workshop

## Introduction
The 101 is a run through Ansible components providing the necessary hands-on to build automation with a good set of principles and best practices.

### Principles 
Some principles to keep in mind during this workshop and as takeaways:
* automation should be considered as coding and as such the content should be hosted on version-control system like Git. 
* better have a KISS than a sorry... Keep It Stupid Simple; start with basic playbook and static inventory then fluffÂ© it up
* write-test-fix loop (think DevOps) then refactor and modularize later

### what's Ansible?

## Let's start!
### It ain't gonna magically happen!
Let's install Ansible on your machine or access a machine with Ansible. Then try the following:
```
ansible localhost -m ping
```
The expected outcome is:
```
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
```
Then try the following:
```
ansible localhost -m setup
``` 
Let's discuss about it for 2 minutes, then forgot about it for a couple of hours and come back to it.

### It ain't gonna magically connect!
Ansible is agentless and doesn't work in a pull approach but in push with credentials.

#### Linux
When it comes to Linux, the connection towards the target is done through SSH.
This is a very basic process, unless SSH has been disabled, only a valid user with SUDO rights is necessary along with a password-less connection. 

To do so, have a bit of play with: 
```
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id
```

#### Win
When it comes to Windows, the connection towards the target is done through WinRM.
Since Windows Vista, WinRM is shipped standard with Windows but needs to be enabled. 
Here is two references to make it happen painless:
* The following powershell script can be used to enable it:
https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/examples/scripts 
* A good blog post about to connect to a Windows host:

### Inventories
Ansible inventories are much more than just a list of target to run automation on and as such it deserves some real attention with some best practices.

Here is a bad example:

```
[mydb]
10.1.2.3
10.1.2.4

[myweb]
myhost01.mydomain.com
myhost02.mydomain.com
```
The above is indeed just a list with no real interest or power features.
What about this one:

```
[mydb]
db1     ansible_host=10.1.2.3
db2     ansible_host=10.1.2.4

[myweb]
web1    ansible_host=myhost01.mydomain.com
web2    ansible_host=myhost02.mydomain.com
```
Then, the concept of groups can be used to make easier automation
```
[mydb]
db1     ansible_host=10.1.2.3
db2     ansible_host=10.1.2.4

[myweb]
web1    ansible_host=myhost01.mydomain.com
web2    ansible_host=myhost02.mydomain.com

[dev]
db1
web1

[uat]
db2
web2
``` 
This inventory will allow to deploy a common set of packages and configurations towards 'mydb' and 'myweb' then deploy the application set towards a the group 'dev' and/or 'uat' with key differentiator like dataset, testings, ... 

The last addition to the inventory is about variables liked to it like:
```
[dev]
var1=valuexyz
var2=valueyxz
```
When working with a large or/and complex inventory, the following CLI commands are useful:
```
$ ansible-inventory -i 101/example --list
{
    "_meta": {
        "hostvars": {
            "db1": {
                "ansible_host": "10.1.2.3"
            }, 
            "db2": {
                "ansible_host": "10.1.2.4"
            }, 
            "web1": {
                "ansible_host": "myhost01.mydomain.com"
            }, 
            "web2": {
                "ansible_host": "myhost02.mydomain.com"
            }
        }
    }, 
    "all": {
        "children": [
            "dev", 
            "mydb", 
            "myweb", 
            "uat", 
            "ungrouped"
        ]
    }, 
    "dev": {
        "hosts": [
            "db1", 
            "var1=valuexyz", 
            "var2=valueyxz", 
            "web1"
        ]
    }, 
    "mydb": {
        "hosts": [
            "db1", 
            "db2"
        ]
    }, 
    "myweb": {
        "hosts": [
            "web1", 
            "web2"
        ]
    }, 
    "uat": {
        "hosts": [
            "db2", 
            "web2"
        ]
    }
}

$ ansible-inventory -i 101/examples/inventory  --graph
@all:
  |--@dev:
  |  |--db1
  |  |--var1=valuexyz
  |  |--var2=valueyxz
  |  |--web1
  |--@mydb:
  |  |--db1
  |  |--db2
  |--@myweb:
  |  |--web1
  |  |--web2
  |--@uat:
  |  |--db2
  |  |--web2
  |--@ungrouped:
```
Note how the variables have been merged with their respective group of hosts.
