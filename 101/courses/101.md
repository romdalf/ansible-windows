# 101 - Ansible Crash-Course Workshop

## Introduction
The 101 is a run through Ansible components providing the necessary hands-on to build automation with a good set of principles and best practices.

### Principles 
Some principles to keep in mind during this workshop and as takeaways:
* automation should be considered as coding and as such the content should be hosted on version-control system like Git. 
* better have a KISS than a sorry... Keep It Stupid Simple; start with basic playbook and static inventory then fluffÂ© it up
* write-test-fix loop (think DevOps) then refactor and modularize later

## Let's start!
### It ain't gonna magically happen!
Let's install Ansible on your machine or access a machine with Ansible. Then try the following:
```
ansible localhost -m ping
```
The expected outcome is:
```
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
```
Then try the following:
```
ansible localhost -m setup
``` 
Let's discuss about it for 2 minutes, then forgot about it for a couple of hours and come back to it.

### It ain't gonna magically connect!


### Inventories
Ansible inventories are much more than just a list of target to run automation on.
