# 101 - Ansible Crash-Course Workshop

### Introduction
Some principles to keep in mind during this workshop and as takeaways:
* automation should be considered as coding and as such the content should be hosted on version-control system like Git. 
* better have a KISS than a sorry... Keep It Stupid Simple; start with basic playbook and static inventory then fluffÂ© it up
* write-test-fix loop (think DevOps) then refactor and modularize later
